Ternary Optimizer
================

This is a tool to rewrite ternary operations into their shorter form (when possible).

It is meant to be used for JavaScript code, but works with any language that uses the ternary operator as `(x?y:z)` and uses the `!` operator.

Here is a list of some examples:
	
	(x?3:2)     //old
	(x+2)       //new, +2 savings
	
	(x?4:5)     //old
	(5-x)       //new, +2 savings
	
	(x?3:0)     //old
	(3*x)       //new, +2 savings
	
	(x?-1:0)    //old
	(-x)        //new, +4 savings
	
	(x?1:-1)    //old
	(2*x-1)     //new, +1 savings
	
	(x?-41:-37) //old
	(4*!x-41)   //new, +2 savings

Features
-------------

- option to prefer the advanced `(2*x+1)` over `(x?3:1)` with equal length
- moves stuff around for better operator precedence (prevents some parentheses)
- automatically removes unnecessary `+0`, `0-`, `+-` and double parentheses

To Do
-------------

- pass our own `x` parameter in `(x?y:z)`
